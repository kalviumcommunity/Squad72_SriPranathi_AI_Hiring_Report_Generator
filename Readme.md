# ðŸ§  AI Hiring Report Generator

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**AI Hiring Report Generator** is an intelligent assistant that analyzes HR datasets (e.g., hiring, attrition, and diversity data) to generate structured, actionable reports. It leverages **LLMs**, **function calling**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, up-to-date, and explainable insights for recruiters, HR teams, and hiring managers.

This tool processes CSV uploads and produces visual and textual summaries, identifies red flags (like high attrition or diversity imbalance), and suggests improvement strategies â€” all automatically.

## ðŸ§± Core Concepts & How Theyâ€™re Implemented

### 1. ðŸ§  Prompting

**What it does**:  
Prompts guide the LLM to behave like an HR expert analyst who interprets structured data and delivers fact-based reports.

**Implementation**:
- **System Prompt** defines the assistant's behavior:
  > "You are an expert HR analyst. Analyze uploaded HR data, detect trends, identify red flags, and suggest improvements. Always be concise and data-driven."
- **User Prompt**: Triggered based on user action (e.g., uploading a CSV and requesting analysis).  
  Example:
  > "Analyze this Q2 hiring and attrition data. Highlight key insights and team issues."

Prompting ensures **correctness** by constraining the modelâ€™s behavior within HR analysis boundaries.

### 2. ðŸ“Š Structured Output

**What it does**:  
Ensures LLM responses are parsed reliably into defined fields for UI display, APIs, or downstream functions.

**Implementation**:
- Model responses follow a strict JSON structure like:
  ```json
  {
    "hiring_trends": ["Marketing hires increased by 35%"],
    "attrition_alerts": ["Tech team lost 3 senior devs"],
    "diversity_score": 68,
    "suggested_actions": ["Start tech hiring for Q3", "Run retention survey"]
  }
